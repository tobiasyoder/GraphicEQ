
1. For running primetime, source synopsys.bash through remote access and execute the primetime command.

    To run primetime on CVLB computer systems, run the following command to directly connect to the hera server

   ssh -X netid@hera.ece.tamu.edu

  (Enter yes when it asks you to authenticate the network as reliable and later type in your netid password) 

2. To obtain the proper min_paths.txt and max_paths.txt follow the procedure described below

report_timing -max_paths 3 -slack_lesser_than 0.0 > max_paths.txt

report_timing -max_paths 3 -delay min -slack_lesser_than 0.0 > min_paths.txt

If no paths are reported for slack_lesser_than 0, increase your slack_lesser_than value to say, 3.0 or 5.0 and run the commands again so that the paths are reported in max_paths.txt and min_paths.txt. You can also change the slack_lesser_than option with slack_more_than option and value equal to 0 .
